I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics from
[The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/),
 and will join the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in January 2026.
My research focuses on Coding Theory and Matrix Theory.

  <h2>📂 Dimension and Bose distance of primitive BCH codes.</h2>

  The table below lists the dimensions and Bose distances of several
primitive BCH codes. These parameters are computed using the formulas
given in Theorems 3, 8, 9, and 10 of paper [1]. The Python programs
implementing these formulas are provided here. In addition, all
parameters were verified using Magma, and the corresponding Magma
programs are also available.
