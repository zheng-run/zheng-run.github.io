I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Mathematics, in 
[The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), and expecting to graduate in Fall 2025.  My research focuses on Coding Theory, Matrix Theory, and Quantum Information. 

##  Open to Positions
-   I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities in **Coding Theory** worldwide, with a start date at the end of 2025. I would greatly appreciate any information or guidance you could provide. Thank you!
